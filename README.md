### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ebla, an enthusiastic Frontend Developer. I have completed my **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Toros University** and my **Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Software at EskiÅŸehir Technical University**. I have been passionate about web development for over 5 years, learning and improving my skills independently.

In the **2021 fall semester**, I was accepted into the Erasmus+ program and spent 5 months in Poland, studying at the **University of AGH**, which gave me a fresh perspective on software development. I also successfully completed the **Re:Coded Frontend Web Development Bootcamp**, where I strengthened my skills in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.  

I am currently working at **Mezitli Belediyesi** as a Frontend Web Developer, where I build web applications using **Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, Docker, and MongoDB**. This role has allowed me to improve my skills in modern frontend frameworks, deployment workflows, and database management.  

Previously, I did a **summer internship at Toros University IT Department** in 2021, where I gained experience with computer hardware, algorithms, and team projects. Technologies I used include:  
- Python  
- PHP  
- JavaScript  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- SQL  

In 2022, I completed a **long-term frontend internship at Z Software, ODTÃœ, Ankara**, where I learned teamwork and collaboration. Technologies I used include:  
- Angular.js  
- Bootstrap  
- Git  
- HTML  
- CSS  

During my academic and professional journey, I have learned a lot about **teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and advanced coding practices**.  

Outside of work, I enjoy **designing websites, going to the gym ðŸ’ª, cooking ðŸ’œ, and watching sitcoms**.
